# ♟️ Chess Game (C++ with SFML)

A fully playable chess game developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming principles, enhanced with **SFML** for rich graphics and immersive sound effects. This project was created as part of an academic course and demonstrates modular design, clean structure, and interactive gameplay.

## 🎮 Features
- Complete chess mechanics with valid piece movements
- Turn-based 2-player functionality
- Interactive GUI using SFML
- Visual feedback on moves and selections
- Sound effects for move, capture, check, and checkmate
- Organized OOP structure for maintainability and clarity

## 🛠️ Built With
- **C++** (OOP design)
- **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio** or your preferred C++ IDE.
3. Make sure **SFML** is properly installed and linked.
4. Build and run the project from `BSCS23122_Source.cpp`.
5. Enjoy playing chess with sound and visuals!
